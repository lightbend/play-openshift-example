Lightbend Red Hat Certification
===============================

### what is this?

This is a sample app we are creating so Lightbend can become certified on OpenShift Platform.

I've taken Play Hello world app, applied Lightbend Orchestration, and sustituted the base image to "registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift".
