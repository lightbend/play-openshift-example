===============================

### what is this?

This is a sample app we are creating so Lightbend can become certified on OpenShift Platform.

I've taken Play Hello world app, applied Lightbend Orchestration, and sustituted the base image to "jboss/base-jdk:8" <https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/base-jdk>.
